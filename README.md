# Kings County Housing Prices Prediction

This project created a model that can predict the prices of homes sold in the Seattle, WA area. All kinds of features related to the houses are provided. Linear and non-linear machine learning methods in scikit-learn library are used to construct the models with selected data. Houseing prices are predicted within a reasonable error range.

## Business Understanding

A real estate agency in Seattle WA wants to predict the housing prices in order to develop market strategies and target potential customers. The prices of houses with various features are provided for year 2014-2015. Geographical data can also be fetched to enrich the pool of features. The study of population structure of residents is also an important factor for the prediction, but it is outside the scope of this project.

## GitHub Repository

A GitHub repo is a good way to keep track of your work, but also to display the work you did to future employers. Your GitHub should contain the following:

- A `README.md` that briefly describes the project and the files within the repo.
- Your cleaned and annotated notebook showing your work.
- A folder with all of your 'working' notebooks where you played around with your data and the modeling process.

## Data Set Information

This data set contains information about houses that were sold in the Seattle area during the last decade. Below is a description of the column names, to help you understand what the data represents. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions relating to what the data means. 

Like every data set, there are some irregularities and quirks. Trust me, there wasn't a house sold with 33 bedrooms, even though the data says there was. *You have to decide how you want to handle that example*. Also, some houses were sold more than once within the time frame of this dataset. Think about how that can be useful information in predicting the selling price.

As you go through this modeling process, think about what determines how much someone will pay for a house.  For example, the larger the house is, the more people will pay for it. If you understand why certain houses cost more than others and represent that in your model, it will be a more accurate model.  

Have fun!
